## What is {package.name}?

{card.description} It's a free, open-source {technology.name} package by Pharaonic.

## How do I install {package.name}?

Run `composer require {package.composer}` in your project's root directory, then `php artisan migrate`.

## What does {package.name} require?

The latest release requires {package.requiresText}.

## Does the liker have to be a user?

No. Any Eloquent model with the `CanLike` trait can like, and any model can be liked. Nothing in the package reads the authenticated user.

## What happens when the same user likes twice at the same moment?

One request creates the like and returns true; the other finds the unique index in its way and returns false. The table never holds two rows for the pair.

## Can I use it with UUID or ULID models?

Yes. Ids are stored as strings of up to 64 characters, so integer, UUID and ULID models can like each other in the same table.
